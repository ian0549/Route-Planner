# Route-Planner
In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.

We will be implementing the A* algorithm for finding the shortest path.

# Resources
This project was built as an implementation of A* algorithm from this [medium post]('https://medium.com/@nicholas.w.swift/easy-a-star-pathfinding-7e6689c7f7b2')

# Acknowledgement
Thanks to Nicholas Swift for a very good explanation and implementation of A* Algorithm block on medium
